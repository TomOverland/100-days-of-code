# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: January 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I revisted my google books project and attempted to do some styling work on it. When I dug into it, I found that the search function had broken. I wasn't able to fix it, and will be revisiting it again tomorrow. It will accept single word searches, but reject multiple words such as 'harry potter'.

**Thoughts**: I'm not quite sure what broke the search. I reverted the code to a previous version that was working, and it is still not working. Now that I know I should be using state to hold the e.target.value of the input, I can take this time to properly code out the input field.

### Day 3: January 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent time learning ComponentDidMount, componentWillUnmount, componentDidUpdate. Finished a form from yesterday that updated state on keystroke.

**Thoughts**: I'm still struggling with learning what "events" are - in the context of using them as parameters to update things like an input's text value using event.target.value on an update function. I continued learning about the life cycle of a React Component today by practicing with componentDidMount. I created a Clock component that updated state with a 'new Date()' on a setInterval delay of 1 second to display the current time.

### Day 2: January 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about container components, presentational components, and propTypes in React.

**Thoughts:** I missed the seventh, as life demanded my attention elsewhere, but spent today coding on Codecademy's Advanced React lessons. They are still teaching class based components, which I am fairly confident in by now. I would like to challenge myself by using functional based components and Redux to create my own hooks.

### Day 1: January 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Updated Resume, started new lesson on Codecademy on Advanced React.

**Thoughts:** I spent today planning out what I would like to get out of these 100 days of coding. The first week, I would like to update my front facing bootcamp projects to be more visually appealing. Once that is complete, I would like to start creating some projects that use Angular, TypeScript, Redux, or other popular tech that complements React.

### Day 0: January 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, continued learning async/await

**Thoughts:** I'm still focusing on preparing my professional materials after the bootcamp ended, and have a meeting scheduled tomorrow with the University's career services. I spent most of my time today making my portfolio more visually appealing. I also continued a Codeacademy lesson on async/await.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
