# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about container components and presentational components in React.

**Thoughts:** I missed the seventh, as life goes, but spent today coding on Codecademy's Advanced React lessons. They are still teaching class based components, which I am fairly confident in by now. I would like to challenge myself by using functional based components and Redux to create my own hooks.

### Day 1: January 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Updated Resume, started new lesson on Codecademy on Advanced React.

**Thoughts:** I spent today planning out what I would like to get out of these 100 days of coding. The first week, I would like to update my front facing bootcamp projects to be more visually appealing. Once that is complete, I would like to start creating some projects that use Angular, TypeScript, Redux, or other popular tech that complements React.

### Day 0: January 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, continued learning async/await

**Thoughts:** I'm still focusing on preparing my professional materials after the bootcamp ended, and have a meeting scheduled tomorrow with the University's career services. I spent most of my time today making my portfolio more visually appealing. I also continued a Codeacademy lesson on async/await.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
